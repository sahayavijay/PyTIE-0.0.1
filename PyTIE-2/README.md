## PyTIE_DS
PyTIE_DS is a free open source Python package for obtaining all the degree-sum based topological indices expressions and its numerical values for multiple layer molecular structure with a single parameter. The package was tested under Windows OS.

## Usage

After successfull installation you can immediately use **PyTIE_DS** in Pip.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python .numberLines}
    python  
    >>> import PyTIE-DS  
    >>> from PyTIE-DS import *
            
## Structure

Currently the package consists of one module: **PyTIE_DS **.

The class method *topological_indices_DegreeSum* and function *topoexpressds*. Using this function, you can obtain all the degree-sum based topological indices expressions of multi-layered molecular structures with a single parameter, provided you give it the appropriate inputs.
