## PyTIE_SMS_DSE
PyTIE_SMS_DSE is a free open source Python package for obtaining all the degree-sum based topological indices expressions and degree-sum based entropy values for a single molecular structure. The package was tested under Windows OS.

## Usage

After successfull installation you can immediately use **PyTIE_SMS_DSE** in Python.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python .numberLines}
    python
    >>> import PyTIE_SMS_DSE
    >>> from PyTIE_SMS_DSE import smstopoexpressds
            
## Structure

Currently the package consists of four modules: **PyTIE_SMS_DSE**.

The class *sms_topological_indices_DegreeSum* and function *smstopoexpressds*. Using this function, you can obtain all the degree-sum based topological indices and degree-sum based entropy values for a single molecular structure, provided you give it the appropriate inputs.
